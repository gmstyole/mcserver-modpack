Minecraft 1.7.10 - Modpack
RPG Fantasy Server: D&D inspired and themed!

Step 1: Download the forge installer zip file, use the forge installer to create a 1.7.10 minecraft client.

Step 2: Download each of the mods (the .jar files), and place them in the mods folder in your minecraft roaming directory.

Step 3: To find your roaming directory for minecraft, press the windows button, type %appdata% with the percent signs included in your windows search bar, and press enter to search.  There you will find the roaming directory, inside you will find a folder named .minecraft.  Open the .minecraft folder and place the mods inside the mods folder, if there is not a mods folder, create one and call it 'mods'.

Step 4: Download the configs.zip file, and place each of the files (.cfg) into the config folder, found in your .minecraft main folder.  Some of the config files belong in their own folders, which I have included just for reference.  Do not over write the AM2 folder or the biomesoplenty folder, just place the config files inside those folders into the appropriate folders with the same name.

Step 5: Download the shaders.zip file, and copy/paste the entire folder called 'shaders' into your .minecraft folder.  If you already have a shaders folder with files in it, do not over write the folder, just place all the files inside the zip into the shaders folder.

Step 6: Play minecraft!  The server modpack is currently in beta testing, if you find any bugs or glitches report them to the minecraft channel.  If your computer is decent at video gaming, you can play minecraft with shaders which add lighting and shadow effects to the game for a more realistic visual experience.  I personally recommend the 'enhanced basic textures' shader pack.

Step 7 (Optional): To play with shaders, open and load 1.7.10 minecraft, while in the menu, go to options, then go to video settings, there you'll find a new tab called 'shaders' with all the shaders and options for them.
